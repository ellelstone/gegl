gegl-chain
----------

A serialization format for GEGL graphs that grew out of the desire to
write one-liner image processing tasks on the commandline.

Everything after -- in a GEGL commandline that contains an input image
is considered the chain of operations.

 $ gegl input.jpg -o output.png -- noise-reduction unsharp-mask

If GEGL is built linking to micro raptor gui, the gegl binary can also act as
an image viewer as well as visualizer for the result of chains of operations.

 $ gegl input.jpg -- noise-reduction unsharp-mask

If an argument on the commandline part of the chain contains a = it is a
property assignment for the preceding operation. For example:

 $ gegl in.jpg -- noise-reduction iterations=4 unsharp-mask

If you try to assign a property that doesn't exist, the error message will
contain a list of valid properties for the operation.

The format treats input and output pads as explicitly linked when they follow
each other, to create a sub-chain hooked up to an aux input assign the aux pad
with the sub chain contained in square brackets, like this:

 $ gegl in.jpg -- noise-reduction iterations=2 over aux=[ text string='hello there' color=white size=32 translate x=100 y=100 dropshadow radius=2 x=1.5 y=1.5 ]

And it is also possible to create reference in the chain, reusing permitting
creating masks for color adjustments based on image content, for instance the
following example, which uses a blurred version of an image as a threshold mask
- which thus becomes a local content dependent thresholding filter.

 $ gegl in.jpg -- id=a threshold aux=[ ref=a gaussian-blur std-dev-x=120 std-dev-y=120 ]

When it is more reasonable to specify dimensions relative to the height of an
image - similar to CSS vh dimensions, GEGL can use a "rel" suffix similar to
the CSS vh unit, on the commandline and in other tools, a scaling factor to
scale "rel" units is passed with the parsing API.

 $ gegl in.jpg -- id=a threshold aux=[ ref=a gaussian-blur std-dev-x=0.1rel std-dev-y=0.1rel ]

If gegl have working gegl:ff-load and gegl:ff-save ops, The gegl binary also
permits simple forms of video processing, like the following:

 $ gegl input.mp4 -o output.ogv -- scale-size x=160 y=120 newsprint period=4

If you want to create a GIF as the final output, it is recommended to create a
temporary video file, and use for instance ffmpeg to create a high quality GIF
with a two pass approach.
